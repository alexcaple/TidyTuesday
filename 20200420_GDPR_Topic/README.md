# GDPR Violations
The data this week comes from [Privacy Affairs](https://www.privacyaffairs.com/gdpr-fines/) via [Roel Hogervorst](https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/blog/2020/04/08/scraping-gdpr-fines/), and explores Europe's "General Data Protection Regulation" fines.

I found it humorous given this is a #TidyTuesday challenges that Spain's violations tended to be released on Tuesdays, and that fines on Tuesday's tended to skew under 25K Euros as well!

With more time I would have loved to explore:
 - Why did Spain issue so many fines in October?
 - Why did Vodafone receive so many fines? 
 - What did the person at the Spanish Data Protection Authority who accessed CCTV cameras look at?!
 
The full data is located under [GDPR Fines](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-04-21/readme.md) in the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repo on GitHub.
