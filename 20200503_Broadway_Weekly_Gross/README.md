# Broadway Weekly Grosses
The data this week comes from [Playbill](https://www.playbill.com/grosses) via [Alex Cookson](https://www.alexcookson.com/post/most-successful-broadway-show-of-all-time/), and explores Broadway's weekly box office grosses over time.

I wanted to explore every theatre's seat utilization through a "small multiple" graphic in this weekâ€™s TidyTuesday challenge. In attempting to do so, I learned there is no immediately easy way to convert an image of points into a clean and ready to go file. Instead, I choose the smallest theatre in the group and manually recreated their seating chart to build the following image:

In addition, I realized I still need to learn how to do two tricks in R:
  - How do I quickly italicize single words in my plot titles?
  - How do I figure out the right deminsions for my final graphic without saving 100 times?
